\section{Simple Test}
Here is an example of a LaTeX file. Here, I am including some in text math, using the dollar sign $x^2+32x=13$. Now I want to include an equation that is not inline, and I do so using the "\" "begin" "{equation}":
\begin{equation}\label{eq:areaCirc}
	\pi R^2 = A
\end{equation}
I can refer to an equation with Eq \eqref{eq:areaCirc}. 

\begin{comment}
I've commented out this section to show you how to add a figure. Delete the lines "begin comment" and "end comment" to include this, but you'll have to have a file called "blank.eps" or change the name of the file to the name of your figure to include in the same folder.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth,clip=true]{blank.eps}
	\caption{Template for a figure, you will need to add the figure.}
	\label{fig:blank}
\end{figure}
I refer to a figure with \ref{fig:blank}.
